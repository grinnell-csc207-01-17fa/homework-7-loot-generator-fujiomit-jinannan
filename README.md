# Introduction
The format of our output for each round looks as follows:

```
Fighting <monster name>...
You have slain <monster name>!
<monster name> dropped:

<complete item name>
<base item statistic>
<additional affix statistics>
```
Afterwards, we prompt the user to see if they wish to fight again:

```
Fight again [y/n]? <echoed user input from Scanner>
```
